### Team Beta ###
* Eric Pollard
* Andrew Bashore
* Grant Byrne
* Ryan Zimmerman
* Wheatley (The Drone)

### Introduction ###
The code contained in this repository serves as a starting point for anyone interested in developing a project with the Parrot AR Drone v2.0 utilizing OpenCV. The goal is to be able to use the functionality of the OpenCV Library plus the coolness of the Drone to study existing intellegent robotic development paradigms.

### What Has Been Accomplished ###
Currently, Team Beta has establish multiple ways to communicate with the drone. There was a significant setback in the beginning when we found that many of the libaries out there were not forwards compatible with version 2.0 of the drone.

Luckily, we have been able to leverage the functionality of the released Parrot API as well utilize some libraries which didn't use the previous Parrot API's as a dependency.

### What Is Left to Do ###
* Fully integrate OpenCV with the codebase
* Programmatically control the drone based on input from the vision system
